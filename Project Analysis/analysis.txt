USER STORY 1: 

CHATBOT: "Greetings, Earthling! I heard you want to cancel your subscription. What's on your mind?"

USER: "I can't afford rent, so I wait to cancel my subscription"

CHATBOT: "How about we pause your subscription for up to 6 months?" 

USER: "Yeah that could work!"

CHATBOT: "How many months are you looking to pause for?" 

USER: "Can we do 4 months?"

CHATBOT: "Yes, that works! Thank you for staying loyal to our coffee company! I have paused your subscription
for 4 months and because you've been so loyal even with your tight budget, we will make your next order 50%. We will
also send a reminder when your subscription is about to resume, so your aware of any charges before they happen. Thank you!"

USER: "Thank You!"


----- What I Learned? -----

1. Might need to change the persona based on the context. For example, if someone said they've lost all their money, then the chatbot 
wouldn't want to keep a super fun and space/star trek themed comments, rather there should be a tone change depending on mood and urgency. 

2. If customer requires more than one offer, than offer all the offers that were discussed if possible. Don't offer something and than take
it away. For example, in this user story, I offered 50% off next subscription, and then offered pause subscription, but I think it doesn't 
make sense to take away the previous offer. 

3. Make the discussion stages longer, for example, when finding out the reason, instead of when the chatbot finds the reason and moving 
immediately to the offer stage of the pipeline. Spend some time in each part of the workflow, identify the type of coffee the customer is 
currently using. For example, figure out what type of coffee that they are using? Ask, what type of plan the user is on?

USER STORY 2: 

CHATBOT: "Greetings, Earthling! I heard you want to cancel your subscription. What's on your mind?"

USER: "I can't afford rent, so I wait to cancel my subscription"

CHATBOT: "How about we pause your subscription for up to 6 months?" 

USER: "No, I don't want this right now. I want to cancel my subscription please cancel it now."

CHATBOT: Goes to cancel it. Tells user that the subscription is canceled and please to come back. Thank them for being a customer and hope 
they return soon!

----- What I Learned? -----

1. Make sure when the user is demanding cancellation, they are angry and frustrated that you go ahead and cancel.

USER STORY 3: 

CHATBOT: "Greetings, Earthling! I heard you want to cancel your subscription. What's on your mind?"

USER: "I don't like the taste of the coffee that you sell."

CHATBOT: "Yeah thats fair. What current coffee plan are you subscribed too?" 

USER: "I'm subscribed to X plan. "

CHATBOT: "What about the flavor do you not like does it feel too jittery or ..., etc." 

USER: "Yeah it feels to jittery and theirs too much caffeine in it."

CHATBOT: "Thats fair I have heard some customers didn't like X coffee for the same reason to either of these products 
they liked the flavor a lot better". -- Recommend different products based on the Users criticism, so you are recommending products
that can fix the criticism. 

USER: "No, I'm not interested in wasting more money on coffee that I don't like."

CHATBOT: "We completely understand, but if you are willing to try it we will give you 50% off your next purchase for the new product that 
you pick."

USER: "I guess I can try a new one. Which one do you recommend?"

CHATBOT: "Because you said that it feels jittery and you don't like the flavor. Why don't you try Y product that solves the issues 
that you originally brought up bc ..."

USER: "Yeah I gues I can do that. Thank you for offering me this deal!"

CHATBOT: "No Problem". 

----- What I Learned? -----

1. Validate the customers concerns about the products verify that what they feel is right? Then, maybe try and switch them to a new 
product based on the concerns that they brought up. 

2. If the customer asks for a recommendation, the chatbot should be able to recommend a new product based on the customers concerns. 
For example, if they say they don't like the flavor of - **Super Caf:** *Warp Speed Blend - 200 mg of caffeine, then you can say that 
some customers that agreed with you liked this other two produt: - **Half-Caf:** *One Small Sip for Man 50 mg of caffeine 
With hints of vanilla and - **Decaf:** *Live Long and De-Caffeinate -10 mg of caffeine - With hints of hazelnut
 because they really liked the vanilla or hazelnut flavor. This also decreases the caffeine count so there it will feel less jittery. 

3. The ChatBot needs to spend time going back and forth with the user to really understand their concerns ask follow up questions ask why? 
Try to identify the bottle neck so that the user can get a resolution that fits what they want.

Here are all the offers: 
Offers Your Chatbot Can Make:
- 50% off their next order of the same or a different product
- Pause their subscription for up to 6 months
- Skip their next order


Potential Solutions to all the possible problem: These are the different offers that make sense to reccomend based on each bucket category.

- Too expensive:
    Too much money right now: 
        - "50% off their next order of the same or a different product"
    If can't afford right now, but maybe afford it at a later time 
         - pause their subscription for up to 6 months
         - skip their next order 
    
- They've stockpiled too much product ( Be Funny here ask how much they've stock piled )
    - Pause their subscription for up to 6 months
    - Skip their next order


- They feel too jittery after drinking (Ask what their current product is so you can get the current caffeine amount?)
    - Recommend different product at 50% off if they stick with you. The different product should have less caffeine 
    - If its the least amount of caffeine product, that they are currently drinking. You can reccomend to 50% off their next order and 
    tell them to drink the coffee in smaller amounts, which should help with the jitteryness. 

- They don’t feel jittery enough after drinking (Ask what their current product is so you can get the current caffeine amount?)
     - - Recommend different product at 50% off if they stick with you. The different product should have more caffeine 
    - If its the most amount of caffeine product, that they are currently drinking. You can reccomend to 50% off their next order and 
    tell them to drink the coffee in larger amounts, which should help with the jitteryness. 


- They don't like the taste: 
    - Recommend different products at 50%. Validate what the user is saying. Say you totally understand and have heard other customers
    say that, but if your still interested a lot of those same customers switched over to Y, Z, etc. new product and they love the taste 
    of this new flavor. I think that we should store all the products in a dictionary and it should have the flavor of the product and 
    the caffeine amount. 


- They’re moving to a new house
    - Recommend that they skip their next month's purchase. We can have the shipping address of the product change and we can 
    pause your subscription until you get settled in your house and you can resume. 

    - If that doesn't work then recommend that they pause their subscription for up to 6 months until they get settled in and 
    the customer can resume their coffee drinking once they are ready 



Persona: 
The Client defines their personality as:
- Fun
- Helpful
- Concise
- Uses Star Trek, Star Wars, and other Space-themed puns

-- Remember make sure that the tone adjusts based on the conversation. If the user is screaming at the ChatBot and is angry, 
you don't want to be making puns and being humorous. However, the default tone other than that should be the tone set by the Persona.
